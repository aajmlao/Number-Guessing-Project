# Number-Guessing-Project
Purpose of the game;

User will choose and write down a number between 1 and 100 or any range, but user need to set the range. User asks the computer to guess what that number is. After each guess, I will provide feedback to the computer by indicating whether its guess is too high, too low, or correct. The program will keep guessing until it correctly identifies the number, and it will keep track of how many guesses it took. After the number is correctly guessed, the program will print out the total number of guesses it took, and ask if the user would like to play again.
